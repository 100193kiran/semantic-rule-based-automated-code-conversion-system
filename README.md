#automated-code-conversion-system
Most software employees are facing challenges on integrating programs written in different languages for implementing the techniques for their software development.
This can be achieved by automating the conversion of programs using nat- ural language programming techniques.
This research presents a novel ‘Semantic Rule-based Automatic Code conversion System (SRACS)’ that uses semantic layering,
keyword identification, and a semantic rule-based constructor. The code snippets for ‘Hello World’, ’For Loop’, ‘While Loop’, ‘If else’, 
‘Factorial’ and ‘Travelling Salesman Program’ are converted from Java to Python and vice versa, and the accuracies are presented.
An average accuracy of 71.57% is achieved for the conversion of the code snippets from Java to Python, and a 77.07% is achieved for Python to Java.
The accuracy is based on the ‘accuracy in the conversion of the variables’,
‘accuracy in the conversion of the attributes’ and in the ‘proper indentation of the code in the target code’


In this research, a novel ‘Semantic Rule-based Automatic Code Conversion System (SRACS)’ is presented that uses semantic layering,
keyword identification, and a semantic rule- based constructor. In the traditional methods labeling of elements is done using the one-to-one element mapping technique.
In the SRACS, the mapping of the code is done using one-to-many mapping that helps in identifying the similar code snippets, and also in the segmentation and layering of the code.
The TensorFlow framework available in the NLTK package is used for identification of keywords in the source codes. 
The accuracy of the converted code snippets from Java to Python is
71.57%. Also, the accuracy for Python to Java is 77.07%.
The SRACS may be extended by training large sets of variables, attributes, and any other needs of the converted code snippets for any other programming languages.
It may find application in the code conversion algorithms for COBOL to Java that Banks, Internal Revenue Services or Legacy Systems of industries use.
